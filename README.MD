## Simple reverse shell (C)
It's a simple reverse shell in C (duh), it uses winsock 2.2 and you have to set your IP and port in the dedicated variables in the code, i tried to document the code well in comments.


## Browser Credential Harvester (Python)
Python tool that harvests Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Brave, Opera ( | GX ) and Vivaldi to put them in a password protected (this part still doesn't work) zip archive.
